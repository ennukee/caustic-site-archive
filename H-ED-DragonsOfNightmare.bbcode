[size=16][b]- - Ysondre Abilities - -[/b][/size]

[b][Nightmare Bloom][/b] - Every 3 seconds, deal low-moderate shadow damage to those standing within its area of effect. If nobody is in the area of effect, it will spawn a [b][Dread Horror][/b] instead (aka soak it).
[b]Dread Horror[/b] (add) - Uses an ability called [b][Wasting Dread][/b], players within 5 yards of the Dread Horror have their damage reduced by 50% (Heroic/Mythic only).
[b][Call Defiled Spirit][/b] - Calls forth a defiled druid spirit from the emerald nightmare, which roots players than detonates. It will root all players within 10 yards ([b]Defiled Vines[/b]) ([i]dispellable[/i]). After a time it will detonate ([b][Defiled Eruption][/b]) and deal very high damage to anyone still within 10 yards.
[size=16][b]- - Emeriss Abilities - -[/b][/size]

[b][Bellowing Roar][/b] (flying mechanic) - Raid-wide fear for 3 seconds.
[/ulist]

[size=24][b]Approach[/b][/size]

[size=16][b](kind of) TL;DR version[/b][/size]: don't stand in shit on the ground (unless told to), don't be in front or behind boss, nuke every add you see

[size=16][b]Detailed version[/b][/size]: 

The way the dragons work: Ysondre is [b]always[/b] on the ground. One of the remaining three dragons will start on the ground (unsure if this is guaranteed to be a specific dragon every time). These dragons [b]all share a health pool[/b]. 

At 70%, the one on the ground will fly into the air and one of the dragons currently in the air will land. At 40%, the same will happen again for the last dragon that has not landed. Each dragon has mechanics specific to being on the ground and being in the air. However, air mechanics are only present on [b]Heroic or higher[/b].

Each dragon has a "Mark" that is applies to everyone within 45 yards (aka max attack range). It applies every 5 seconds and if it reaches 10 stacks, you will be stunned for 30 seconds. Nothing can remove this except death (or waiting it out). Thus, unless you are capable of taking the secondary dragon (not Ysondre) within 50 seconds, it is recommended to swap sides. Do NOT accidentally take stacks of the other active dragon ([i]I'm looking at you multi-dotters[/i]), as the debuffs last for 40 seconds so taking a stack in the middle of the phase will screw you over.

If the the swap-points are longer than 50s (I expect it will be), then the raid must change sides approximately every 40s to avoid reaching that 10th stack.

Each dragon has a breath. Face dragons towards outside, only tank should be in front. They also have a Tail Lash (unsure if this ABILITY is Mythic only or if the knockback is Mythic only).

At all times, be on alert for various ground effects ([b][Nightmare Blast][/b] and [b][Defiled Vines][/b]). Once the [b][Nightmare Bloom][/b] spawns from it, SOAK IT IMMEDIATELY. Even if you aren't assigned to it, soak it until the correct soaker arrives. Any unnecessary [b]Dread Horror[/b] spawns will be detrimental. If you get rooted by [b][Defiled Vines][/b], call for a dispel immediately.

[b]- - WHEN EMERISS IS GROUNDED - -[/b]

Whoever gets [b][Volatile Infection][/b] needs to leave the group ASAP and remain outside for the entire duration.

Watch for the [b]Essence of Corruption[/b] add spawns. They must be interrupted.

[b]Lethon flying[/b]: Watch for Shadow Burst and make sure no healer gets affected by the expiring split
[b]Taerar flying[/b]: /shrug

[b]- - WHEN LETHON IS GROUNDED - -[/b]

Due to [b][Siphon Spirit][/b], it is recommended all ranged players remain as far from the boss as possible. If this can affect melee, it's recommended melee stay on Ysondre during this. Also if it can affect melee, hero-ing and potting here to force a transition ASAP (so melee don't get stunned by Ysondre) is likely a good idea.

Watch for shit on the ground ([b][Gloom][/b] impacts)

Keep watch for [b][Siphon Spirit][/b] fragment adds. They will cause a large setback (much like blood globule healing in Kilrogg) if they reach the boss.

[b]Emeriss flying[/b]: Don't be near dying dragons 
[b]Taerar flying[/b]: /shrug

[b]- - WHEN TAERAR IS GROUNDED - -[/b]

Watch the Taerar tank closely as he will be holding both Taerar shades and will be taking a lot of damage from [b][Corrupted Breath][/b].

Be aware of the fog that seeps from the boss, as colliding with it will put you to sleep for 6 seconds and deal a good chunk of damage per second in that time.

[b]Tank CDs[/b]: Taerar shade split.
[b]DPS CDs[/b]: If [b][Siphon Spirit][/b] hits melee, then whenever Lethon lands will be the time to Hero/Pot/CD
